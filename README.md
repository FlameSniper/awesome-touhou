This is a community driven list of everything valuable and interesting in the Touhou Community.

Touhou is among the biggest and oldest communities in the internet, spanning multiple languages and subcultures, you can find just about everything and this is very intimidating to newcomers and veterans alike. Touhou History is vast and that makes it hard to navigate, but not anymore!

Our goal is curating the best of the best The Community has made, with the idea to facilitate discoverability, archival/historical efforts and make community contact between different parts of the fandom easier.

We really value your help, without it, this project would wither away very quickly. Please read the following section if you are interested in helping out.

New to Touhou? Please read [Getting Started (shoot 'em up focused)](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Getting_Started), [Fandom](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Fandom) and [Touhou Reddit's Geting Started](https://www.reddit.com/r/touhou/comments/yt87b4/where_to_get_started_with_touhou_version_51/)

## Contributing & Rules
If your work is mentioned in this project and you don't want to have it displayed, please contact us.

We have a few rules:

- **Don't Be An Asshole:**
The media here must be digestible to a wide audience. It has to contain things that are respectful and considerate to other people's circumstances. If necessary, this rule will get expanded, your morality and common sense should be good enough to respect others, don't prove us wrong.

- **No Spam:**
We value effort and the most widely useful information. Outside certain cases like Wikis or important content, we avoid giving too much attention to a few individuals to give everyone a fair chance. For example, if you are an artist that wants to be here, link your main platform and avoid placing your pieces individually.

Feel welcome to contribute! Please submit a pull request, create an issue or contact me. 
We ask that in your contributions, specifically pull requests, you edit `README.md`.
It is also important that in your pull request you follow the correct markdown format. Follow the alphabetical order when adding new things and give some reasoning behind why adding XYZ to the list is a good idea in your issue/pull request.

You can also give ideas for the project and everything that can improve it is welcome. If you don't know how to work with Github's version control and contributing system (Git), see this detailed [Guide](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests) made by Github.

**awesome-touhou needs your help! If you are proficient in a language that is not English or Spanish, please check out potential-additions.md. We need someone who can verify the quality of links in languages that we don't know!**

**About forum.md**

**forum.md** is another version of the list, designed to be more compact and ideal to place in forums. To update it, just copy and replace the old version with everything below [Thanks And Contributors](#thanks-and-contributors), as the difference is the introductory text, not the list's content. You can convert the list from Markdown into your desired format using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

The currently used command to generate reliable html versions is:
    
    pandoc --from gfm --to html5 --standalone --no-highlight OG-FILE.md -o DESTINY-FILE
